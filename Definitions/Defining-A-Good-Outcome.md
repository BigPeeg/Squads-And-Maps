*Customer* : This is the source of the outcome. It may be an actual customer or an internal customer. The Customer will be the beneficiary of the delivered outcome. External Customers may be represented internally by a proxy. The field is included to give some context to the Outcome's problem. 

*Problem Statement* : This gives a brief outline of the motivation behind the outcome, explaining the problem that needs to be solved.

*Objective* : This is a qualitative description of what needs to be achieved.

*Key Results* : These give quantitative descriptions of what the completed objective looks like. 

*Required Date* : This is an optional field.  In some circumstances a problem has to be solved within a specific time-frame. It could be that in the short-term a sub-optimal solution is acceptable (reflected in the KRs) with an additional Outcome defined that allows for a more considered solution.

A well formed *Objective* can be confirmed with the following questions
- Is the objective broad in outlook?
- Is the objective inspiring?
- Does the objective help in achieving the company goals?
- Does the objective align with corporate strategy?
- Is the objective indispensable?

A well formed *Key Result* can be confirmed with the following questions
- Is the Key Result Specific, Measurable, Actionable and Relevant
- Is the KR a result and not just another task/activity?
- Does the KR help in achieving the objective it belongs to?
- Does the KR belong to either a stretch or an operational goal category?
- Is the KR important enough to appear in the top 5 KRs for the objective?

The individual *Outcome* defines the goal, it is the 'why' something needs to be done. The *Outcome* would be expected to map to a Theme, Epic or Feature in the 'what' domain. It may be that several *Epics* or *Features* are identified to achieve the *Key Results* of an individual *Outcome*.
