- **Assignee**: This would typically be used to assign work to an individual if jira is being used to track project work. For most of our Issue type ‘Assignee’ has no significance and will be hidden.

We will be using this for some issues as the person who needs to next respond, provide information, push forward or make progress on an issue type. If you think of a game of tennis, the ball is in the Assignee’s court.

E.G. An Outcome with the status ‘Needs more details’ – Could be assigned to the person who we think might be able to provide the additional detail.

- **Reporter**: The person who created the item. This has no other significance in our workflow.
