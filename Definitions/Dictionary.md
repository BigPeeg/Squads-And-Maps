- **Clients** – A customer or client of Glasswall.
- **Decision** – This is where the required stakeholder can provide context and then vote on a chosen decision. It is quite a generic issue type at the moment and can be linked to any other issue type. E.G. An Outcome or a Key Result.
I think the people voting on the decision would be the stakeholders and maybe some of the squad contributors. Depending on the context, what the decision is about and what it is attached to. 
Its recorded on the decision issue itself in Jira. Theres no specific format for that yet, people can vote by comment or editing the description. As long as their decision is attached to their name.
They could either be discussed in a meeting, teams call, or just by comments on the decision issue.
- **Guild** - A lightweight community of interest where people across the whole company gather and share knowledge of a specific area. Anyone can join or leave a Guild at any time. E.G: ‘React’, ‘Performance’
- **IT System** – A system or platform which staff use and have accounts on. These systems are owned and managed by our IT team. E.G: ‘Jira’, ‘GitHub’
- **Key Result** - Measurable deliveries. An outcome would be broken down into specific and measurable key results.
- **Outcome** - Short term objective of a squad.
- **Person** – A person.
- **Policies** – Organisational policies. 
- **Role** - The function assumed, or part played by a person or thing in a situation. In some situations this could be your job title, or something close to it, but not always. You could assume a role in a squad which is not aligned with your title.
- **Squad** - Vertical group of roles that deliver an outcome. A squad is cross-functional and constitutes all roles needed to deliver its outcomes end to end. 
- **Team** - Horizontal group of people that have a common competency area. E.G. Cloud Dev, Core QA, SRE. This is your existing line management structure. 
- **Tribe** - A collection of squads that cover the same business area. E.G. Glasswall Engine, SaaS
- **takeholder** – someone who is invested in a thing. They should be consulted with or kept informed of progress and delivery.
- **Customer** - A client of the organisation or an internal customer. All sqauds should have customers/clients. These are the consumers of the delivered outcome. Who will use what is being delivered
- **Member** - someone who actively participates in and contributes towards.​
