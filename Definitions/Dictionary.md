Teams and Guilds have members
Entity and ITSystem’s have stakeholders.
Squads have:
squad developers / quad stakeholders / squad leader
Squad stakeholder - someone who has an interest in the outcomes of that squad​
Squad developer - more a contributor, anyone who plays a role in that squad (dev, qa, support, sales, SRE, product). ​
Squad leader is the only exception to the idea that a Squad is a completely flat hierarchy. The squad is self managed, the squad leader will meet with other squad leaders weekly to negotiate resource availability for their squad. They will need to raise risks blockers to their squad. The leader is the person ultimately accountable for the squad outcomes being delivered. They do not manage the members of their squad but lead them on the path to delivery.
